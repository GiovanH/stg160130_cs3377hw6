This project (c) Seth Giovanetti, all rights reserved.

Those rights are distributed as follows. 
For the purposes of this document, the "Expiry date" is 2019-01-01.
For the purposes of this document, the "Product" shall be any copyrightable work included with this license. This includes, but is not limited to, files written by them. This excludes files such as external libraries, which already have their own copyright information. 

UNTIL THE EXPIRY DATE, the product, written by Seth Giovanetti (henceforth "the originator") may be stored, read, copied, and modified, FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE of accurately grading it against requirements. 

As of 12:00 AM on the day of the expiry date, ALL OF THESE RIGHTS ARE IMMEDIATELY REVOKED. No party other than the originator of the product has any rights, express or implied, to its intellectual property. Thus, no other party has any of the following rights:
- Retention: Storing the information contained in the files in any form whatsoever. Disallowed storage media includes printed copies, compressed copies, encoded copies, encrypted copies, and others.
- Access: Reading the information contained in the project, including doing so with an automated system, even if said system is not intended to provide a reconstruction of the full product.
- Distribution: Copying or distributing versions or "copies" as defined below.  

This list is not inclusive. Other rights should not be implied as being granted to any party other than the originator of the product.

Modifications of the product from which the original product can be reconstructed (known as "copies") fall under the same protections as they contain the same intellectual property. These copies are subject to the same protections as the originals.

The originator retains no rights over metadata generated about the files (such as its grade) as long as such metadata cannot be used to reconstruct the product, as such data would fall under the category of "copy".

By opening, reading, executing, or constructing metadata about the product, you acknowledge and understand the terms under which you act. Namely, your current rights and the change in your rights (as the originator has clearly laid out) at the date and time of the expiry date.

This document abides by all relevant copyright policies, including UTDPP1002.
